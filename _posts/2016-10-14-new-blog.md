title: My new blog
---

Welcome to my new blog. I've been running my wordpress blog on a VPS for years, until I
eventually pulled the plug on it. For a (very) short time, I went over to [wordpress.com][1]
for a new place on the web, but that really just wasn't for me.

So, this blog is actually hosted by [Github Pages][2], and powered by [Jekyll][3], and the
amazing [Lanyon theme][4].

I will be writing some blog posts here and there, hopefully, but don't expect too many. If
history is any indication, my posting velocity will approach zero. Oh, I will be re-adding
the blog posts I wrote in the past, because it'd be a shame to lose those.
